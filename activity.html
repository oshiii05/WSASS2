    <h1>My Favourite Activity: Soccer</h1>
    <p class="intro">One of my favourite activities is playing soccer. I love the teamwork and strategy involved in the game. I believe it helps me develop my leadership skills and keeps me physically fit. Soccer is more than just a game to me, it's a way of life. It teaches me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of teamwork.</p>
